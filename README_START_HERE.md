## 🔍 What's Wrong (Quick Summary)

Based on the diagnostic I ran on your local system:

### ✅ Working Correctly (2 users):
- User ID 3: Has deposit, has passive income, everything matches ✅
- User ID 5: Has deposit, has passive income, everything matches ✅

### ❌ Issues Found (2 users):
- **User ID 2**: Has $2.81 income but NO deposit ❌
- **User ID 4**: Has $0.90 income but NO deposit ❌

**Why this is a problem:**
Passive income should ONLY exist if the user has made a credited deposit.

**Possible causes:**
1. It's referral/milestone income (VALID - no fix needed)
2. It's passive income without deposit (BUG - needs cleanup)
3. Manual database changes (needs investigation)

**The fix script will:**
- Investigate what type of income it is
- Clean up invalid passive income
- Recalculate wallet balances
- Verify everything is correct

## 📊 How Passive Income Works

### Simple Explanation:
```
1. User deposits $100
   ├─ 80% ($80) → available_usd (user's wallet)
   └─ 20% ($20) → hold_usd (platform)

2. Starting DAY 1 after deposit:
   ├─ Daily rate: 0.4% (varies by day)
   ├─ Gross earning: $100 × 0.4% = $0.40
   ├─ User share: $0.40 × 80% = $0.32
   └─ Added to: income_usd (withdrawable)

3. Continues for 90 days
   └─ Total: ~$130 passive income
```

### The Three Wallet Balances:
1. **`available_usd`** = Deposit share (80%)
2. **`income_usd`** = All earnings (passive, referral, milestone, pool)
3. **`hold_usd`** = Platform hold (20%)

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Daily Automation
For passive income to generate automatically, you MUST set:
```
ENABLE_SCHEDULER=True
```
in your Render environment variables.

Without this, you'll need to manually run:
```bash
python manage.py run_daily_earnings
```
every day.

### Data Integrity
The system maintains two records for each passive earning:
1. `PassiveEarning` model entry
2. `Transaction` record

These must stay in sync. The fix script verifies this.

### Wallet Balances
The `wallet.income_usd` field should ALWAYS equal the sum of all income transactions. The fix script recalculates this.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know everything is working when:

```
✅ All users with deposits have passive income
✅ Passive earning count = Days since deposit
✅ No users with passive income but no deposits
✅ All wallet balances match transaction totals
✅ Daily earnings run automatically
✅ No errors in diagnostic
```
