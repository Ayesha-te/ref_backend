# Duplicate Referral Bonus Issue - Fixed! 🎉

## Problem Summary

**Issue:** Users were receiving multiple referral bonuses for the same team member.

**Example from Screenshot:**
- User has **3 team members**
- User received **5 referral bonuses** of Rs84 each
- **2 extra bonuses** were paid (duplicates)

## Root Cause

The Django signal `on_user_approved` in `apps/accounts/signals.py` was firing **multiple times** for the same user approval. This happened because:

1. The signal triggers on **every save** of a User with `is_approved=True`
2. If a user record is saved multiple times after approval (for any reason), the signal fires again
3. Each signal trigger created new referral payouts, transactions, and deposits

## How Rs84 is Calculated

The Rs84 bonus is correct for a 1410 PKR signup:

```
Signup Fee: 1410 PKR
L1 Referral Rate: 6%
Bonus: 1410 × 6% = 84.6 PKR ≈ Rs84
```

So the **amount is correct**, but it was being paid **multiple times** for the same referral.

## The Fix - 3 Layers of Protection

### 1. Signal-Level Duplicate Prevention ✅

**File:** `apps/accounts/signals.py`

Added checks before creating payouts:

```python
# Check if referral payouts already exist
already_paid = ReferralPayout.objects.filter(referee=instance).exists()
if not already_paid:
    pay_on_package_purchase(instance)

# Check if Monday contribution already made
already_contributed = Transaction.objects.filter(
    wallet=wallet,
    meta__type='global_pool_contribution',
    meta__source='monday_joining'
).exists()

# Check if initial deposit already created
already_deposited = DepositRequest.objects.filter(
    user=instance,
    tx_id='SIGNUP-INIT'
).exists()
```

### 2. Database-Level Unique Constraint ✅

**File:** `apps/referrals/models.py`

Added unique constraint to prevent duplicate payouts at database level:

```python
class ReferralPayout(models.Model):
    # ... fields ...
    
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-created_at']
        unique_together = [['referrer', 'referee', 'level']]
```

This ensures that even if the signal fires multiple times, the database will reject duplicate payouts.

### 3. Migration Created ✅

**File:** `apps/referrals/migrations/0003_referralmilestoneprogress_current_sum_usd_and_more.py`

The migration adds the unique constraint to the database.

## What Was Fixed

### Before Fix:
```
User Approved → Signal Fires → Bonuses Paid ✅
User Saved Again → Signal Fires → Bonuses Paid Again ❌ (DUPLICATE!)
User Saved Again → Signal Fires → Bonuses Paid Again ❌ (DUPLICATE!)
```

### After Fix:
```
User Approved → Signal Fires → Check if already paid → Bonuses Paid ✅
User Saved Again → Signal Fires → Check if already paid → Skip (already paid) ✅
User Saved Again → Signal Fires → Check if already paid → Skip (already paid) ✅
```

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Apply the Migration

```bash
python manage.py migrate referrals
```

This will add the unique constraint to the database.

### Step 2: Clean Up Existing Duplicates

Run the cleanup script to remove existing duplicate bonuses:

```bash
python cleanup_duplicate_bonuses.py
```

This script will:
1. Identify all duplicate referral payouts
2. Show you what will be deleted
3. Ask for confirmation
4. Delete duplicate payouts (keeping the first one)
5. Reverse duplicate transactions
6. Update wallet balances

### Step 3: Deploy to Production

1. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix duplicate referral bonus issue"
   git push
   ```

2. On Render, the deployment will automatically:
   - Apply the migration
   - Start using the new signal logic

3. After deployment, run the cleanup script on production:
   - Go to Render Shell
   - Run: `python cleanup_duplicate_bonuses.py`

## Diagnostic Tools

### Check for Duplicates

Run the diagnostic script to check any user's referral data:

```bash
python diagnose_duplicate_bonuses.py
```

This will show:
- Team members (direct referrals)
- Referral payouts received
- Duplicate detection
- Transaction analysis
- Summary and recommendations

## Testing the Fix

### Test Case 1: New User Approval
1. Create a new user with a referral code
2. Approve the user
3. Check that exactly 1 referral payout is created
4. Save the user again (without changing approval)
5. Verify no new payout is created ✅

### Test Case 2: Duplicate Prevention at DB Level
1. Try to create a duplicate payout manually
2. Database should reject it with unique constraint error ✅

### Test Case 3: Multiple Saves
1. Approve a user
2. Save the user multiple times
3. Verify only 1 payout, 1 deposit, 1 Monday contribution ✅

## Impact Analysis

### What Changed:
- ✅ Duplicate referral bonuses prevented
- ✅ Duplicate Monday contributions prevented
- ✅ Duplicate initial deposits prevented
- ✅ Database constraint added for safety

### What Didn't Change:
- ✅ Referral bonus calculation (still 6% of signup fee)
- ✅ Referral levels (L1=6%, L2=3%, L3=1%)
- ✅ Signup fee (1410 PKR default)
- ✅ User approval workflow

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

1. **Referral Payouts:** Check that each user gets exactly 1 payout per referral
2. **Transaction Logs:** Verify no duplicate transactions
3. **Wallet Balances:** Ensure balances are correct
4. **Error Logs:** Watch for any unique constraint violations (would indicate attempted duplicates)

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the diagnostic script output
2. Review the transaction logs
3. Check for any error messages in Render logs
4. Run the cleanup script if duplicates are found

1. `apps/accounts/signals.py` - Added duplicate prevention checks
2. `apps/referrals/models.py` - Added unique constraint
3. `apps/referrals/migrations/0003_*.py` - Migration file (auto-generated)

## Files Created
