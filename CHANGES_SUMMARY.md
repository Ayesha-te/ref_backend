# Signup Fee to Passive Income Integration - Changes Summary

## What Was Changed

Your request was to make signup fees generate passive income just like regular deposits. Here's what was implemented:

### Changes Overview

#### 1. **Signup Approval Now Creates Auto-Credited Deposit**
   - **File:** `apps/accounts/views.py`
   - **Function:** `admin_signup_proof_action()`
   - **What it does:**
     - When admin approves a signup proof, it automatically creates a DepositRequest
     - The deposit is immediately credited (no need for separate admin action)
     - Amount is converted from PKR to USD using the admin FX rate
     - Wallet is credited: 80% to available funds, 20% to platform hold
     - Global pool receives 0.5% of the signup fee

#### 2. **Passive Income Now Includes Signup Fees**
   - **File:** `core/middleware.py`
   - **Function:** `AutoDailyEarningsMiddleware._check_and_process_daily_earnings()`
   - **What it does:**
     - Removed exclusion of SIGNUP-INIT deposits from passive income
     - Passive income now starts immediately after signup approval
     - When users make additional deposits, passive income is recalculated with the new total
     - Day counter continues from where it left off (no restart)

#### 3. **Removed Duplicate Deposit Creation**
   - **File:** `apps/accounts/signals.py`
   - **Function:** `on_user_approved()`
   - **What it does:**
     - Removed old signup deposit creation logic from signal handler
     - Now handled exclusively in the approval view for clarity
     - Prevents duplicate deposits

## How It Works Now

### User Journey

```
1. User Signup
   └─ User submits signup with payment proof (amount in PKR)
   └─ Proof status = PENDING

2. Admin Approves Signup
   └─ Endpoint: POST /api/accounts/admin/signup-proofs/{id}/action/
   └─ Payload: {"action": "APPROVE"}
   └─ System automatically:
      ├─ Creates DepositRequest with tx_id='SIGNUP-INIT'
      ├─ Sets status='CREDITED' immediately
      ├─ Converts amount to USD
      ├─ Credits wallet (80% available, 20% hold)
      └─ Adds to global pool (0.5%)

3. Passive Income Starts Next Day (Day 1)
   └─ Daily middleware calculates earnings:
      ├─ Gets total of ALL credited deposits (signup + any additions)
      ├─ Applies daily percentage from schedule
      ├─ Continues day counter from previous day
      └─ Credits income to wallet

4. User Makes Additional Deposit (Optional)
   └─ Admin credits the deposit normally
   └─ Next day, passive income uses the new total
      └─ Example: 
         - Signup: $20 → Day 1 income = $20 * 0.4% * 0.80
         - New Deposit: $30 → Total: $50
         - Day 2 income = $50 * 0.4% * 0.80 (higher amount)
```

## Key Features

### ✅ No Fixed Amount Required
- Each user can have any signup fee amount
- System automatically uses their actual signup proof amount
- Additional deposits can be any amount

### ✅ Schedule Follows Plan
- Day 1-10: 0.4% daily
- Day 11-20: 0.6% daily
- Day 21-30: 0.8% daily
- Day 31-60: 1.0% daily
- Day 61-90: 1.3% daily

### ✅ Deposits Stack for Passive Income
- Signup fee: $20
- Later deposit: +$30
- Passive income calculated on: $50 total
- Day counter continues (doesn't restart)

### ✅ Day 0 Protection
- No passive income on the same day as deposit
- User must wait at least 1 day after deposit
- Prevents gaming/exploitation

### ✅ Consistent with Existing System
- Uses same wallet credit logic as regular deposits
- Same global pool collection (0.5%)
- Same economics settings
- Same transaction tracking

## Configuration

No changes needed to configuration! Uses existing settings:

```python
# core/settings.py
ADMIN_USD_TO_PKR = 280  # FX rate for conversion
SIGNUP_FEE_PKR = 1410   # Fallback (normally from SignupProof)

ECONOMICS = {
    'USER_WALLET_SHARE': 0.80,    # 80% to available
    'GLOBAL_POOL_CUT': 0.005,     # 0.5% to pool
    'PASSIVE_SCHEDULE': [          # Daily percentages
        (1, 10, 0.004),
        (11, 20, 0.006),
        (21, 30, 0.008),
        (31, 60, 0.010),
        (61, 90, 0.013),
    ]
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Test 1: Approve a Signup
- [ ] Go to admin panel
- [ ] Approve a pending signup proof
- [ ] Check DepositRequest created with tx_id='SIGNUP-INIT'
- [ ] Verify wallet.available_usd increased (80% of signup amount)
- [ ] Verify wallet.hold_usd increased (20% of signup amount)

### ✅ Test 2: Verify Passive Income Starts
- [ ] Wait for next day or trigger earnings manually
- [ ] Check PassiveEarning records created for user
- [ ] Verify wallet.income_usd increased
- [ ] Amount should be: signup_amount * 0.004 * 0.80 (for day 1)

### ✅ Test 3: Make Additional Deposit
- [ ] Same user makes another deposit
- [ ] Admin credits the new deposit
- [ ] Next day's passive income should use total of both deposits
- [ ] Example: $20 signup + $10 deposit = $30 for next day's calculation

### ✅ Test 4: Check Schedule Progression
- [ ] Day 10: Passive income at 0.4%
- [ ] Day 11: Passive income at 0.6%
- [ ] Amount should increase even if no new deposit
- [ ] Only based on same total, but higher daily percentage

## Example Scenario

Day 1: Passive Income Generated
  ✓ Daily percent: 0.4%
  ✓ Gross: $17.86 * 0.004 = $0.071

  ✓ Wallet income_usd += 0.172

Day 11: Passive Income (New Tier)
