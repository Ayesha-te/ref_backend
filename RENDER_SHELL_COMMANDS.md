## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "User has income but no deposit"
**Cause:** User has income_usd but no credited deposit
**Solution:**
1. Check if it's referral/milestone income (VALID)
2. If it's passive income (INVALID - bug)
3. Run investigation command to see transaction types

### Issue 2: "Missing passive earnings"
**Cause:** Daily earnings command didn't run for some days
**Solution:**
```bash
python manage.py run_daily_earnings --backfill-from-date 2025-10-01
```

### Issue 3: "Record count mismatch"
**Cause:** PassiveEarning count ‚â† Transaction count
**Solution:**
```bash
python manage.py fix_all_passive_income
```

### Issue 4: "Amount discrepancy"
**Cause:** wallet.income_usd doesn't match transaction totals
**Solution:**
```bash
python manage.py fix_all_passive_income
```

## üîÑ Daily Automation Setup

### Check if Scheduler is Enabled
```bash
python manage.py shell
```

Then:
```python
from django.conf import settings
print(f"ENABLE_SCHEDULER: {settings.ENABLE_SCHEDULER}")
exit()
```

### Enable Scheduler (if needed)
Add to Render environment variables:
```
ENABLE_SCHEDULER=True
```

This will automatically run `run_daily_earnings` every day at midnight.

---

## üìù Step-by-Step Fix Process

### Step 1: Check Current Status
```bash
python manage.py comprehensive_passive_check
```
**Look for:**
- Users with deposits
- Users with passive earnings
- Any issues flagged

### Step 2: Run the Fix
```bash
python manage.py fix_all_passive_income
```
**This will:**
- Backfill missing earnings
- Fix wallet balances
- Verify everything

### Step 3: Verify Fix Worked
```bash
python manage.py comprehensive_passive_check
```
**Should show:**
- All users with deposits have correct passive income
- No issues flagged
- All balances match

### Step 4: Enable Daily Automation
Set environment variable:
```
ENABLE_SCHEDULER=True
```

### Step 5: Test Daily Run
```bash
python manage.py run_daily_earnings
```
**Should show:**
- "No new earnings to generate" (if already up to date)
- OR "Generated earnings for X users"

## üéØ Expected Results After Fix

### For Users WITH Deposits:
- ‚úÖ PassiveEarning records = Days since deposit
- ‚úÖ Transaction records = PassiveEarning records
- ‚úÖ wallet.income_usd = Sum of all income transactions
- ‚úÖ Daily earnings continue automatically

### For Users WITHOUT Deposits:
- ‚úÖ No PassiveEarning records
- ‚úÖ No passive Transaction records
- ‚úÖ wallet.income_usd = $0.00 (or only referral/milestone bonuses)

## üìû Need Help?

If you see unexpected results, run this investigation:

```bash
python manage.py shell
```

```python
from apps.wallets.models import Wallet, Transaction, DepositRequest
from apps.earnings.models import PassiveEarning
from apps.accounts.models import User

# Check all users with issues
users = User.objects.filter(is_approved=True)

for user in users:
    wallet = Wallet.objects.filter(user=user).first()
    if not wallet:
        continue
    
    # Check deposits
    deposits = DepositRequest.objects.filter(
        user=user,
        status='CREDITED'
    ).exclude(tx_id='SIGNUP-INIT')
    
    # Check passive earnings
    passive_count = PassiveEarning.objects.filter(user=user).count()
    
    # Check income
    income = wallet.income_usd
    
    # Flag issues
    if income > 0 and deposits.count() == 0:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  User {user.username} (ID: {user.id}): Has ${income} income but NO deposits")
        
        # Show where income came from
        txs = Transaction.objects.filter(wallet=wallet, type='CREDIT').exclude(meta__contains={'type': 'deposit'})
        for tx in txs:
            print(f"   - ${tx.amount_usd} from {tx.meta.get('type', 'unknown')} on {tx.created_at}")
        print()

exit()
```

This will show you EXACTLY what's wrong and where the income came from!
