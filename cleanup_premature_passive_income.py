"""
Cleanup script to remove premature passive income transactions
that were generated on the same day as the deposit (day 0).

This script will:
1. Find all users with passive income transactions
2. Check if they received passive income on day 0 (same day as deposit)
3. Remove those premature transactions
4. Adjust wallet balances accordingly
