## 📈 Bonus Calculation (New System)

### Formula:
```
Actual Deposit (PKR) ÷ Exchange Rate = USD Amount
USD Amount × Percentage = Bonus in USD
Bonus in USD × Exchange Rate = Bonus in PKR
```

### Examples:
```
1410 PKR ÷ 280 = $5.04 USD
$5.04 × 6% = $0.30 USD
$0.30 × 280 = Rs84 PKR ✅

5410 PKR ÷ 280 = $19.32 USD
$19.32 × 6% = $1.16 USD
$1.16 × 280 = Rs325 PKR ✅
```
