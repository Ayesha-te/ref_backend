# Scheduler Fix Instructions for Render (Paid Plan)

## Current Status
- ✅ Scheduler is ENABLED in settings
- ❌ Scheduler is NOT RUNNING on production
- ⚠️ Passive income automation is NOT working

## Root Cause
The background scheduler thread is not persisting on Render's platform. This is common with daemon threads in production environments.

## Solution Options

### **OPTION 1: Use Render Cron Jobs (RECOMMENDED)**

Render's paid plans support native Cron Jobs which are more reliable than background threads.

#### Steps:

1. **Go to your Render Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: https://dashboard.render.com/

2. **Create a New Cron Job**
   - Click "New +" → "Cron Job"
   - Connect to your GitHub repository

3. **Configure the Cron Job**
   ```
   Name: Daily Earnings Generation
   Environment: Python 3
   Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
   Command: python manage.py run_daily_earnings
   Schedule: 0 1 * * * (runs at 00:01 UTC daily)
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables** (same as your web service)
   - Copy all environment variables from your web service
   - Especially: DATABASE_URL, DJANGO_SECRET_KEY, etc.

5. **Deploy the Cron Job**

#### Advantages:
- ✅ More reliable than background threads
- ✅ Separate process from web service
- ✅ Better logging and monitoring
- ✅ Automatic retries on failure
- ✅ No impact on web service performance

### **OPTION 2: Fix the Background Scheduler (Alternative)**

If you prefer to keep the scheduler in the web service, we need to make it more robust.

#### The Problem:
The current scheduler uses a daemon thread that may be killed by Render's process manager.

#### The Fix:
We need to ensure the scheduler persists and restarts if it fails.

#### Steps:

1. **Update the scheduler initialization** to be more robust
2. **Add health checks** to restart the scheduler if it dies
3. **Ensure proper logging** to track scheduler status

I can implement these changes if you prefer this approach.

### **OPTION 3: Hybrid Approach (BEST)**

Use both approaches for maximum reliability:
1. **Render Cron Job** for daily earnings (primary)
2. **Background scheduler** as backup with health monitoring

## Recommended Action

**For paid Render plans, I recommend OPTION 1 (Render Cron Jobs)** because:
- It's the most reliable solution
- It's designed for this exact use case
- It won't affect your web service performance
- It's easier to monitor and debug

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Set up Render Cron Job (takes 5 minutes)
2. **Optional**: Keep background scheduler as backup
3. **Verify**: Check logs after 24 hours to confirm it's working

## Testing

After setup, you can manually trigger the cron job to test:
- Go to Render Dashboard → Your Cron Job → "Trigger Job"
- Check the logs to verify it runs successfully

## Monitoring

To check if it's working:
- Check Render Cron Job logs daily
- Use the admin panel to verify earnings are being generated
- Monitor the scheduler status endpoint: `/api/earnings/scheduler-status/`
