# Passive Income & Global Pool Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Passive Income Visibility
**Problem**: Passive income was showing for all users, even those who hadn't made any investments.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ **Backend**: Modified admin users view to only show passive income for users who have made actual investments (excluding signup initial deposits)
- ✅ **Frontend**: Added logic to only show the "Passive Income" card for users who have passive income transactions
- ✅ **Logic**: The daily earnings generation already correctly only processes users with investments

### 2. Global Pool Distribution
**Problem**: Global pool was being distributed only to users with investments or referrals, but should be distributed to all approved users.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Backend**: Modified `run_daily_earnings.py` to distribute global pool to ALL approved users
- ✅ **Collection**: Still collects 0.5 USD from Monday joiners
- ✅ **Distribution**: Now distributes to all approved users on Mondays

### 3. Admin Panel Display
**Problem**: Admin panel was showing passive income amounts for all users.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Backend**: Updated `AdminUsersListView` to check if user has investments before showing passive income
- ✅ **Display**: Users without investments now show "0.00" for passive income in admin panel

## Files Modified

### Backend Files:
1. `ref_backend/apps/earnings/management/commands/run_daily_earnings.py`
   - Changed global pool distribution from "users with investments or referrals" to "all approved users"
   - Updated logging messages

2. `ref_backend/apps/accounts/views.py`
   - Added investment check in `AdminUsersListView`
   - Only shows passive income for users with actual investments

### Frontend Files:
1. `src/components/DashboardOverview.tsx`
   - Added `hasPassiveIncome` check
   - Conditionally shows "Passive Income" card only for users with passive income transactions

### New Files:
1. `ref_backend/apps/earnings/management/commands/test_passive_income_fix.py`
   - Test command to verify the fixes work correctly

## How It Works Now

### Passive Income:
1. **Eligibility**: Only users who have made actual investments (deposits excluding signup initial) receive passive income
2. **Generation**: Daily earnings command only processes eligible users
3. **Display**: 
   - Frontend only shows passive income card if user has passive income transactions
   - Admin panel only shows passive income amounts for users with investments
   - Users without investments see "0.00" in admin panel

### Global Pool:
1. **Collection**: Every Monday, collect 0.5 USD from users who joined that Monday
2. **Distribution**: Distribute the collected amount to ALL approved users (not just those with investments)
3. **Tax**: 20% tax is applied, so users receive 80% of their share

## Testing

Run the test command to verify everything works:
```bash
python manage.py test_passive_income_fix
```

This will show:
- Which users have investments and should see passive income
- Which users don't have investments and should NOT see passive income
- Any issues with the current data

## Summary

✅ **Passive income now only shows for users who have made investments**
✅ **Global pool distributes to all approved users as requested**
✅ **Admin panel correctly filters passive income display**
✅ **Frontend conditionally shows passive income card**

The system now works exactly as specified:
- Passive income follows the investment model (like shown on "How it Works" page)
- Global pool benefits all approved users who have signed up
- Admin panel shows accurate data for each user type
