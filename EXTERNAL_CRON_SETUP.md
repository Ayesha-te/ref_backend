# 🔄 External Cron Service Setup Guide

Since you have a **paid Render Web Service** (but not Cron Jobs), you can use **free external monitoring services** to trigger your daily passive income automation.

---

## ✅ What I've Fixed

1. **Modified the trigger endpoint** to accept requests from external services (no admin login required)
2. **Added optional security** with a secret key to prevent unauthorized access
3. **Enabled both GET and POST** requests for compatibility with different cron services

---

## 🎯 Your Trigger Endpoint

```
https://ref-backend-fw8y.onrender.com/api/earnings/trigger-earnings-now/
```

This endpoint will:
- Generate daily passive income for all users
- Distribute weekly global pool (on Mondays)
- Return success/failure status

## 🛡️ Security Enhancement (Optional but Recommended)

To prevent unauthorized access, add a secret key:

### Step 1: Add Environment Variable in Render

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Select your web service
3. Go to "Environment" tab
4. Add new variable:
   - **Key:** `CRON_SECRET_KEY`
   - **Value:** `your-random-secret-here-12345` (use a strong random string)
5. Click "Save Changes"

### Step 2: Update Your Cron Service

**For EasyCron:**
- In "Advanced Options" → "Custom HTTP Headers"
- Add: `X-Cron-Secret: your-random-secret-here-12345`

**For UptimeRobot:**
- In "Advanced Settings" → "Custom HTTP Headers"
- Add: `X-Cron-Secret: your-random-secret-here-12345`

**For Cron-Job.org:**
- In "Request settings" → "Request headers"
- Add: `X-Cron-Secret: your-random-secret-here-12345`

## 📊 Verification

### Check if it's working:

1. **Immediate Test:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://ref-backend-fw8y.onrender.com/api/earnings/trigger-earnings-now/
   ```
   
   Should return:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "message": "Earnings generation triggered successfully",
     "output": "..."
   }
   ```

2. **After 24 Hours:**
   - Check your cron service logs
   - Check Render logs: https://dashboard.render.com/ → Your Service → Logs
   - Check user wallets in admin panel for new passive income

3. **Using Test Script:**
   ```bash
   python test_scheduler_status.py
   ```

---

## 🎯 Recommended Setup

**My Recommendation:** Use **EasyCron** for precise timing

**Why?**
- ✅ Runs at exact time (00:01 UTC daily)
- ✅ Better logging and monitoring
- ✅ Easy to test with "Execute Now" button
- ✅ Free forever (20 jobs limit)
- ✅ Email notifications on failure

**Backup:** Also enable the improved background scheduler (already done in code)

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: enable external cron trigger for daily earnings"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Wait for Render to Deploy

- Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
- Wait for deployment to complete (~2-5 minutes)

### 3. Set Up External Cron Service

- Follow one of the options above (I recommend EasyCron)

### 4. Test Immediately

- Use "Execute Now" or "Run Now" button in your cron service
- Check Render logs to confirm it worked

### 5. Verify After 24 Hours

- Check cron service execution logs
- Check Render application logs
- Check user wallets for new passive income

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid or missing secret key"
**Solution:** Make sure `CRON_SECRET_KEY` environment variable matches the header you're sending

### Issue: "Timeout" or "No response"
**Solution:** 
- Increase timeout to 60 seconds in cron service
- Check Render logs for errors
- Make sure your Render service is not sleeping (paid plans don't sleep)

### Issue: "404 Not Found"
**Solution:** 
- Make sure URL is exactly: `https://ref-backend-fw8y.onrender.com/api/earnings/trigger-earnings-now/`
- Check that deployment completed successfully

### Issue: Earnings not generating
**Solution:**
- Check Render logs for errors
- Run test script: `python test_scheduler_status.py`
- Manually trigger via admin panel
